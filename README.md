# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Repository contains a tidy data set (subj_act_avg.txt) created following the following steps:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Code to follow the steps outlined: run_analysis.R

Code Book (CodeBook.md): describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data
